# Continuous Assessment-5: Front-end Web Development

Welcome to the Continuous Assessment-5 of Front-end Web Development! In this project, I have created a website fully utilizing Tailwind CSS and implementing features such as search functionality, registration, and API data fetching without reloading the page.

## Project Overview

Books play a vital role in our lives, and ensuring their accessibility is crucial. To address the issue of book availability, this website aims to provide a platform for accessing books online. Utilizing the provided API, users can browse through a curated list of books.

### API Endpoint
- **API:** [https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com/books](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com/books)

   - Users can search for books based on keywords.
   - The search bar filters books based on the entered text.

2. **Registration**
   - Clicking on the "Register" button directs users to a registration form.
   - The form includes fields for Name, Email, Password, Repeat Password and checkbox for accepting terms and conditions.
   - Validation constraints are enforced for each field.

3. **Book Listing**
   - Books are displayed in a user-friendly manner.
   - Each book entry contains relevant details such as title, author, and rating.

## Registration Form Constraints

- **Name:** Should be between 3 to 30 characters.
- **Email:** Must be a valid email address.
